# Image Map Resizer

It's a lightweight pure JavaScript image Map resizer for HTML `<map>`. All you need is to load and initialize the script on your website.

## How it works

Simple add between `<header>` and `</header>`:

```
<script src="hex_imgmapresizer.js"></script>
```

And add just before `</body>` tag:
```
<script>
hex_imgmapresizer();
</script>
```

That's it!

## If the script not work

Try to create the image map on the original image size. And please open an issue! I will appreciate!
